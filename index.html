    <p>One of my favorite activities is playing the guitar. My dad taught me how to play when I was younger, and it is a big part of our relationship and how we are so close. The first song I learned how to play was "Wagon Wheel" by Darius Rucker. As I got older, I learned to play songs that both my dad and I loved. Our favorite song to play together is <a href="https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/john-mayer/in-the-blood-chords-1980523">"In the Blood"</a> by John Mayer.</p>
